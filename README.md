R exercise involving business statistics

This folder contains selected exercise problems  done in R from Business Statistics For Contemporary Decision Making 4th Edition or later edition, Ken Black.

This is my approach in learning statistics and R at the same time.

I will continue to update this folder on monthly basis.

If you find any errors or in the script, let me know.

Send me an email explaining what the problem is and I will gladly fix it.

Thank You! for your cooperation.
